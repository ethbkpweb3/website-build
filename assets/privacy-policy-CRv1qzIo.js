We are not responsible for the information practices of such third-party websites.\n\n\n# **4. DO WE USE COOKIES AND OTHER TRACKING TECHNOLOGIES?**\n\n---\n\nWe may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice.\n\n\n# **5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?**\n\n---\n\nWe will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.\n\nWhen we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.\n\n\n# **6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?**\n\n---\n\nWe have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.\n\n\n# **7. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?**\n\n---\n\nWe do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at [admin@opz.com](mailto:admin@opz.com).\n\n\n# **8. COLLECTION AND TRANSFER OF DATA OUTSIDE OF THE EEA**\n\n---\n\nWe may collect Personal Data from customers located in the EEA. To facilitate the services we provide to customers located in the EEA, we request explicit consent for the transfer of Personal Data from the EEA to locations outside of the area. If you are an individual located in the EEA and you decline to consent to such transfer, you will no longer be able to use OKX and our services. But you will have the ability to withdraw your digital assets.\n\n**Withdrawing your consent:** If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section [‘"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" ‘](#12.-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice%3F) below or updating your preferences.\n\nHowever, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.\n\n**Opting out of marketing and promotional communications:** You can unsubscribe from our marketing and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in the section [‘"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"‘](#12.-how-can-you-contact-us-about-this-notice%3F) below. You will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests, or for other non-marketing purposes.\n\n\n### **Account Information**\n\nIf you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:\nLog in to your account settings and update your user account or please contact Support Center with the subject “DATA CHANGE”.\nUpon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal requirements.\n\n**Cookies and similar technologies:** Most Web browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features or services of our Services.

CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES**\n\n---\n\nMost web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.\n\n\n# **10. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?**\n\n---\n\nWe may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.\n\n\n# **11. HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?**\n\n---\n\nBased on the applicable laws of your country, you may have the right to request access to the personal information we collect from you, change that information, or delete it. To request to review, update, or delete your personal information, please contact Support Center with the subject “DATA INQUIRY”..\n\nPlease note that despite the aforementioned, there may be instances in which we are unable to comply with a request to edit, update, access, or delete an account profile or Personal Information. Examples include, but are not limited to:\n\n\n\n- where we must retain the data to comply with federal, state, or local laws, or for accounting or tax purposes;\n\n- any basis under applicable law where such a request can be denied;\n\n- where we are required to comply with a federal, state, or local civil, criminal, or regulatory inquiry, investigation, subpoena, or summons;\n\n- if we need to cooperate with law enforcement agencies regarding conduct or activity that a business, service provider, or third party believes may violate federal, state, or local law;\n\n- where information must be retained to exercise or defend legal claims;\n\n\n# **12. HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?**\n\nIf you have questions or comments about this notice, you may email us at [admin@opz.com](mailto:admin@opz.com).\n\n')
