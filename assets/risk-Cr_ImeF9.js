                updated: "March 22, 2022",
                terms: s("\n## Risk Disclosure\n\nThis Risk Disclosure (this “**Statement**”) applies to the OPZ electronic trading platform, encompassing all relevant mobile applications (the “**app**”) and websites that facilitate access to the OPZ trading platform (collectively referred to as the “**Platform**”). The Platform is provided by OPZ (also known as the “**Company**”, “**we**”, “**us**” or “**our**”), and is incorporated as a part of the Service Agreement between the Company and you, the User (the “**Service Agreement**”).\n\nBy using the OPZ Platform and Site, you affirm that you understand all the risks associated with transactions involving Digital Assets and/or the use of the OPZ Platform. It is essential that you comprehend and agree that you are solely responsible for assessing the appropriateness, potential value, nature, and suitability of any trading decisions and actions involving the OPZ Platform. The Company does not provide advice or recommendations regarding any Digital Assets, including the appropriateness and/or suitability of any investment strategies for any Digital Asset. **You confirm that you fully understand that any use or access of the site is undertaken entirely at your own risk.** This statement does not disclose all risks associated with Digital Assets and using the Platform. Therefore, you, the User, must carefully consider if using the Site and/or OPZ Platform is suitable for you, given your financial situation.\n\n---\n\n## 1. **Digital Asset Value and Investment Risks**\n\n---\n\nThe value, price, and potential income derived from any Digital Asset products can exhibit substantial fluctuations, leading to significant losses which could be detrimental to your financial health. It's crucial to understand that a specific Digital Asset product may face a reduction in price, even to the point of losing its entire value. Trading or investing in Digital Asset products inherently carries a risk - you may incur a loss. The profitability of buying and selling any Digital Asset is not guaranteed.\n\n\n#### Nature and Stability of Digital Assets\nUsers of the OPZ Platform should comprehend that Digital Assets are not legal tender and lack backing by any government or tangible commodities such as gold or silver. There's no central bank that can implement corrective measures to protect the value of Digital Assets, like Bitcoin, during a crisis or issue additional Digital Assets. Digital Assets operate autonomously and largely unregulated. Trust in this system is predicated on a digital, decentralized, and partially anonymous infrastructure that relies on cryptography and peer-to-peer networking to maintain its integrity.\n\n\n#### Irreversibility of Transactions and Market Dependency\nTransactions involving Digital Assets may be irreversible, meaning losses from personal decisions, accidental transactions, or fraudulent activities might be unrecoverable. It's important to note that transactions involving Digital Assets are typically considered complete when recorded on a public ledger, which may not coincide with the initiation time or date of the transaction. The value of a Digital Asset largely depends on the market participants' ongoing willingness to exchange fiat currency (or Digital Assets) for Digital Assets. If the market for a particular Digital Asset ceases to exist, it may result in a permanent and total loss of that Digital Asset's value.\n\n\n#### Risks Pertaining to Cybersecurity and Risks Associated with Derivatives, Margin Trading, and Digital Asset/Security Borrowing\nGiven the nature of Digital Assets, they may be more susceptible to fraudulent activities or cyberattacks. This can lead to complications with the OPZ Platform, potentially limiting access to or use of your Digital Assets. The trading of Digital Assets may also be influenced by fluctuating market demands based on confidence in Digital Assets. This could lead to a collapse in demand relative to supply.\n\n\n#### Deposits and Insurance Applicability\nFunds transferred into your OPZ Account are not recognized as deposits under relevant financial laws, rules, or regulations related to assets, digital or otherwise, in your jurisdiction. Furthermore, deposit insurance protection does not apply to any Digital Assets held in your Account.\n\n---\n\n## 2. **Risks Associated with Derivatives, Margin Trading, and Digital Asset/Security**\n\n---\n\n(a) Derivatives Products carry a high degree of risk, primarily due to their frequent involvement with gearing or leverage. A minor movement in the price of the underlying Digital Asset may result in a substantially larger movement in the price of the Digital Asset, which can be either favourable or unfavourable.\n\n(b) Dealing with the financing of a transaction by deposit of collateral involves significant financial risks of a loss. You may sustain losses exceeding the level of Digital Assets you have/had deposited as collateral with the Company.\n## 3. **Risks Related to Taxation and Legal Changes**\n\n---\n\n(a) Any proceeds from the sale of Digital Assets or other income may be subject to tax, levies, duties, or other fees or charges imposed by the regulatory authorities. This can include taxation levied by withholding at source. Currently, tax law relating specifically to Digital Assets may not have been fully and clearly established in certain countries.\n\n(b) With the constantly evolving laws and regulations concerning Digital Assets, current interpretations may become obsolete, and changes may necessitate retrospective actions. You should be aware that you are responsible for understanding and complying with the tax implications in your specific jurisdiction.\n\n(c) Legislation and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level could adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Assets. Users should stay informed about changes to laws and regulations that could impact their Digital Assets transactions.\n\n---\n\n## 4. **Terms of Service and Risks Involved with Multi-Party Computation (MPC)**\n\n---\n\nThis section pertains to the terms of service and risks associated with the use of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) within the OPZ Platform.\n\n(a) Understanding MPC: By using the OPZ Platform, you acknowledge that you understand what MPC is and how it works. MPC is a cryptographic protocol that enables multiple parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. While MPC has significant potential benefits, it also carries risks. It's crucial that you fully understand these risks before you begin using MPC on the OPZ Platform.\n\n(b) Personal Responsibility: You are responsible for all actions taken in relation to MPC within your OPZ account. You should carefully consider whether your use of MPC is appropriate given your personal circumstances and risk tolerance.\n\n(c) Legal Compliance: You are responsible for ensuring that your use of MPC complies with all applicable laws and regulations. The Company will not be liable for any legal issues that may arise from your use of MPC.\n\n(d) No Insurance: Digital Assets involved in MPC are not insured by any government, financial institution, or any other type of insurance scheme. If losses or thefts occur, there may be no way to retrieve the lost Digital Assets.\n\n(e) Indemnity: You agree to indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including legal fees) arising out of your use of MPC on the OPZ Platform.\n\nBy using MPC on the OPZ Platform, you signify your agreement to these terms. If you do not agree with these terms, you should not use the MPC service on the OPZ Platform.\n\n\n---\n\n## 5. **Additional Risks**\n\n---\n\n(a) The use, transfer, exchange, and value of Digital Assets may be adversely affected by legislative and regulatory changes, or actions at the state, federal, or international level.\n\n(b) **NEITHER THE COMPANY NOR THE OPZ PLATFORM IS REGISTERED AS A BROKER OR DEALER, AN ALTERNATIVE TRADING SYSTEM, A NATIONAL SECURITIES EXCHANGE OR A CAPITAL MARKET SERVICE PROVIDER IN ANY JURISDICTION. NO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY OR SELF-REGULATORY INSTITUTION WILL OVERSEE THE TRADING AND SETTLEMENT OF ANY TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING DIGITAL ASSETS**\n\n(c) In the event of a change in law, the OPZ Platform may be suspended or closed down, leading to the closure of all User Accounts and potential losses. The Company does not accept liability for any such losses incurred.\n\nIn conclusion, by using the OPZ Platform, you affirm that you have read, understood, and accepted the risks described in this Risk Disclosure. As a user, it's crucial that you consider carefully whether using the OPZ Platform and Site is appropriate for you, given your financial circumstances. You should fully understand that you may lose all Digital Assets in your Account, and there can be specific market conditions where it may be difficult or impossible to liquidate a position.\n\n")
